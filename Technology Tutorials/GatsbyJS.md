# Gatsby.js



## Installation of Development Environment

Gatsby is built with Node.js. Therefore, we will need to install `node` and `npm` before getting Gatsby.

Gatsby also uses Git behind the scene to download and install required files. Therefore, `git` should be available on the computer as well. 



### Gatsby CLI

The Gatsby CLI tool is used to create new Gatsby-powered sites and run commands for developing Gatsby sites. It is published as an npm package. 

```sh
# Installing Gatsby CLI
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```
